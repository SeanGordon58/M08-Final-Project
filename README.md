Written and tested using VS Code. Added screenshots of each step of registering, logging in, purchasing tickets, and viewing purchased tickets, along with each error. 
Also added txt files that are the aftermath of my examples shown in the screenshots, which show how many seats are left in each area per each game, the users username and password for logging in, and each purchased ticket in detail.
Apologies for how scrambled the files are, as I could not figure out how to organize them.
